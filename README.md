## Hi there 👋

## Domenico Puzone

I’m Domenico, a passionate and versatile professional with a strong background in SEO, AI Automation, and marketing. Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of working across diverse industries, including iGaming and marketing agencies, where I’ve developed expertise in Technical SEO, strategic planning, and team leadership. As an early adopter of technology and a lifelong learner, I’m always exploring new ways to innovate and stay ahead in my field.

Currently, I’m based in Málaga and work as AI OPS Specialist in Lottoland.  . I’m also collaborating with a partner to launch a podcast about artificial intelligence, covering everything from beginner concepts to advanced topics. Beyond work, I’m an avid traveler, a creative thinker, and someone who thrives on learning new skills and taking on exciting challenges—whether it’s designing a medieval role-playing game backend in Python or experimenting with plant care at home.

I’m fluent in Italian, Spanish, English, and Napolitano, and I enjoy sharing my knowledge while connecting with others. With a passion for design, leadership, and innovation, I’m constantly seeking opportunities to grow and contribute meaningfully to every project I take on.

🔭 I’m currently working on AI Ops Specialist
